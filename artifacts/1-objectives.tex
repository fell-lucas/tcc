    \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
      \item Research: Analyze similar tools, state the processes that will be made available by the tool, conduct surveys with the organizers and participants of \acp{OA}, understand the limitations of current processes.
      \item Planning: Elicitate functional and non functional requirements, identify stakeholders, define architecture and technologies.
      \item Development: Elaborate the features defined, build the entire front end.
      \item Deployment: Perform experiments with possible end users, collect feedback and implement appropriate improvements and corrections.
