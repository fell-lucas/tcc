  I would like to thank my family, Isabel, Marco and MaitÃª for their unbounded love and support. I wouldn't be here without their help throughout the years and the education they were able to provide me. For that, I will be always grateful.

  I am also thankful for the knowledge and education I received from each of my professors during my time at the University. This work wouldn't be possible without them. College has been a challenge since the start, especially during the COVID pandemic, but thanks only to their patience and effort in teaching, that was I able to reach this far in the course.

  My advisor, Maicon Bernardino, for motivating, guiding, and being a great supervisor. For without his help and patience, this whole study could've been much more difficult than it needs to be.

  My friend and roommate throughout the college years, Igor, for the bond we created through college that I'm sure will last for many years to come. Also, thanks for all the discussions and knowledge sharing we've had during each discipline of the course. It would've been much, much harder to come this far without his help.
