\begin{agradecimentos}

I would like to thank my family, Isabel, Marco and MaitÃª for their unbounded love and support. I wouldn't  be here without their help throughout the years. 

I am also grateful for the knowledge and education I received from each of my professors during my time at the University. This work wouldn't be possible without them.

And my advisor, Maicon Bernardino, for his guidance and patience.
